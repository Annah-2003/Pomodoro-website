 This is a `time management application` that shifts its focus to dynamic zones.

## Features
 Dynamic Focus Zones: Customizable environments for different tasks.
 Task Management: Record tasks and goals.
 Task Tracking: Track completed tasks.
 Productivity Reports: Generate reports on productivity.
